**Summary:**
I always was interested in  a visual part. I would like to explore an important practical aspect , how this  objects  look like and  how it  works. When I browse a web, I want  to know how the  plan of actions is made ,  which code is  used and why, what can I add and create, because I want to do it myself. 

My goals are to improve my skills in programming, to realize myself in different projects and to develop myself in other directions in this sphere.

I can work in a team, go deep into details, find necessary information myself. 

**Skills:**
At that moment, I know HTML, CSS and a little JS, but I always to be in progress.

**Code example:**
This is task wich I solved from [“The Modern JavaScript Tutorial”](https://learn.javascript.ru/).

```
function sumInput() {

  let numbers = [];

  while (true) {

    let value = prompt("Enter the number", 0);

    if (value === "" || value === null || !isFinite(value)) break;

    numbers.push(+value);
  }

  let sum = 0;
  for (let number of numbers) {
    sum += number;
  }
  return sum;
}

alert( sumInput() );
```

**Education:**
I have read different articles about JS and basic data structures. Also I have completed online courses ”CS50”, ” HTML Academy ” and can use the Codewars platform.
Recently I read online manual [“The Modern JavaScript Tutorial”](https://learn.javascript.ru/).
