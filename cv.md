**Summary:**
I always was interested in  a visual part. I would like to explore an important practical aspect , how this  objects  look like and  how it  works. When I browse a web, I want  to know how the  plan of actions is made ,  which code is  used and why, what can I add and create, because I want to do it myself. 

My goals are to improve my skills in programming, to realize myself in different projects and to develop myself in other directions in this sphere.

I can work in a team, go deep into details, find necessary information myself. 

**Skills:**
At that moment, I know HTML, CSS and a little JS, but I always to be in progress.
